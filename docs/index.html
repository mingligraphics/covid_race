However, full or partial data about the race and ethnicity of the deceased is known for only 62% of deaths. </p> <p>So far, many U.S. states have not released Covid-19 data by race. It is essential that policy-makers and other decision-makers have access to these data to inform their response to the pandemic. It is also important that these data are released publicly to shed light on the intersecting forces of racial disparities, underlying conditions, and poverty that affect how the virus spreads throughout the U.S.</p> <iframe title="Racial Data Unavailable in Many States" aria-label="USA states choropleth map" id="datawrapper-chart-t1KCL" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/t1KCL/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width:0;min-width:100%!important;border:none;" height="400"></iframe>
</div>  <div class="story-body"> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began reporting national data on confirmed coronavirus cases by race and ethnicity as of April 17, 2020. They suggest that the virus is having disproportionate effects, with Black people accounting for 20% of deaths with known race/ethnicity compared to 13% of the total population as of April 21, 2020. </p> <p>However, race and ethnicity is missing or unspecified for nearly two-thirds (65%) of the CDC-reported cases, limiting the ability to interpret the data.</p>  <p style="text-align:center"><iframe src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QSYje/1/" width="100%" height="246" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency></iframe></p> <p>In the majority of states reporting data, Black people accounted for a higher share of deaths (in 19 of 24 states) compared to their share of the total population. These disparities were particularly large in Wisconsin, where Black people made up an over six-times higher share of deaths (39% vs. 6%) compared to their share of the total population. </p> <iframe title="Black Americans Hit Hardest by COVID-19" aria-label="Range Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-GUmhl" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/GUmhl/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width:0;min-width:100%!important;border:none;" height="497"></iframe><script>!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}(),function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>
</div>   <div class="story-body"> <h2></h2> <p>Dr. Lisa A. Cooper, Professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity, said that there are likely multiple causes for these disparities. </p> <p>Existing racial disparities in the rates of chronic medical conditions increase the risk among ethnic minorities for serious complications of the novel coronavirus and resulting higher death rates.</p> <p>Additionally, the observed disparities in how the disease affects racial/ethnic minority populations highlight inequities in socio-economic status, living conditions, and access to care in the U.S. Because many racial and ethnic minority persons live in poverty, they are experiencing this pandemic in a different way. For example, they may rely on public transit if they cannot afford a car, need to shop more frequently for basic necessities since they cannot afford to stockpile goods, and do not have health insurance or access to regular medical care. Social distancing may not be a convenient or realistic option for many, because they may live in small, multi-family apartments or homes.</p> <p>Ethnic minorities are also more likely to be exposed to infection while working, due to their overrepresentation in essential jobs in transportation, government, health care, and food supply services, and in low wage or temporary jobs that may not allow telework or provide paid sick leave.</p>
